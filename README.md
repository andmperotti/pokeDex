A simple app that pings pokeapi.co API and uses the response to populate elements in our app, so when given a name it returns an image and its type of Pokemon.
Now we have functionality for locations listed where to find the Pokemon.
I'll add logic later to tell the user they cannot look up locations if a Pokemon is not searched for.
